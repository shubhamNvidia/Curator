"""Name -> class / target resolution over the Milestone-1 discovery catalog.

Every recipe ``ref`` is a registered agent-ready stage class name. We resolve it
through the existing foundation catalog so the recipe can only reference real,
importable stages (the anti-hallucination guarantee), and derive the Hydra
``_target_`` string for round-tripping to ``config.run``.

    A stage's reads and writes come from its PARAMETERS -- ``SplitLongAudioStage(

    honest answer comes from an instance, which is what ``build_contract`` has always needed
    and ``describe`` never gave it.

    Instantiating to ask is safe: no audio stage does I/O in ``__init__`` (a regression test
    pins that), and models load in ``setup()``, which this never calls. Execution knobs are
    dropped first so a caller can pass a recipe's params verbatim without the ``resources``
    entry turning into a spurious "could not be configured".

    Falls back to the instance-free contract rather than raising, because a stage with required
    arguments has to stay describable to a caller who does not yet know what to pass -- that
    caller is asking in order to find out. The fallback is labelled; see

"""Reuse scan — find prior work for a recipe, and hand the user the choice.

Probes the artifact registry with the recipe's Merkle step keys and reports the longest
prefix that is provably safe to reuse, together with an approval card a human can actually
judge: what the earlier run was FOR, what it ran, on what data, where the output is, when,
how it scored, and how much time reusing it saves.

Two rules shape the UX, and both matter:

* **Never silent.** Reuse is always disclosed. Anything above a trivial saving asks first,
  because "you got yesterday's answer" is not a detail to bury in a log line.
* **Never nagging.** No candidate means no prompt at all. A saving *measured* under
  :data:`AUTO_REUSE_SEC` is simply taken and disclosed. A low-trust candidate is shown with
  its weakness spelled out and the *fresh* option pre-selected.

The word "measured" carries weight there. Silence about a stage's cost is not evidence that it
was cheap, and reading it that way is how an unmeasured hour of transcription qualified as
trivial. Nothing is auto-taken on an assumption; see :func:`_unpriced`.

See ``REUSE_ARCHITECTURE.md``.

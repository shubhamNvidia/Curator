"""Pipeline-level validation for agent-composed audio pipelines.

``validate_pipeline([stageA, stageB, ...])`` walks an ordered list of configured
stages and checks they actually compose — each stage's required inputs must be
produced by an upstream stage or be present in the initial task. It also surfaces
resource-gate problems (GPU needed but none available).

A read is satisfied by matching *either* the literal key it names or the semantic
*role* behind it. Both routes are needed: role matching tolerates a producer that
writes ``resampled_audio_filepath`` where the consumer reads ``audio_filepath``,
and key matching covers the reverse, where the names agree but the two sides file
that name under different roles. Requiring both would report breaks in pipelines
that run.

Composites are expanded (see :mod:`nemo_curator.stages.audio._agent._composite`) so the
stages inside them are checked too — the requirements of the stages that do the
work, rather than the empty contract the composite advertises. Missing reads inside
composites remain advisory; a proven incompatible live value is an error. A composite that cannot be expanded, or whose children
include something with no contract at all, falls back to being treated as opaque:
it is reported, and reads after it are no longer judged by role.

Two levels of confidence, deliberately separated:

* ``report.ok`` certifies a *role-level necessary condition* — every required
  input role is available. This is rename-tolerant by design and is the gate.
* ``report.keys_ok`` adds the stronger *literal-key-identity* check: each
  role-satisfied read's actual key *value* is produced upstream (or seeded). A
  ``True`` ``ok`` with ``False`` ``keys_ok`` means the roles line up but a
  producer key was renamed away from what the consumer reads — the pipeline
  would validate yet yield zero rows at runtime. It is surfaced as a WARNING
  (not an error) so that legitimate reads of source-manifest columns are not
  false-rejected.

This is advisory and read-only — it never executes a stage. ``ok`` is a
necessary, not sufficient, condition for a pipeline to run.

            Defaults to ``{"audio_filepath"}``. Seeding this lets the
            literal-key check (``keys_ok``) recognize reads satisfied by the
            input rather than by an upstream producer.
        initial_segment_roles: Semantic roles present inside the input task's
            segment dictionaries. Defaults to an empty nested state.
        initial_segment_keys: Literal key VALUES present inside the input
            task's segment dictionaries. Defaults to an empty nested state.
            When omitted with explicit ``initial_segment_roles``, canonical
            role-as-literal key values are inferred using the top-level policy.
        initial_tensor_keys: Which seeded keys hold a resident tensor. ``None`` --
            the default -- infers them from top-level and segment seed keys by
            role, which covers the canonical ``waveform``. Pass this when the
            input carries a tensor under a name whose role cannot be inferred
            (e.g. ``audio_tensor``).
            Pass an empty set when a schema contains a waveform-named column but
            the input values are known not to be resident tensors.
        initial_segment_tensor_keys: The nested (segment-scope) equivalent of
            ``initial_tensor_keys``. ``None`` -- the default -- infers resident
            segment tensors from the segment seed keys by role. Pass this when a
            segment carries a tensor under a name whose role cannot be inferred.
        initial_task_type: Class name of the task the first stage will be handed
            (e.g. ``"EmptyTask"`` for a pipeline that starts at a source, ``"AudioTask"``
            for a suffix resumed from a manifest). ``None`` -- the default -- leaves the
            first stage's input unchecked rather than guessing at it.
        available_gpus: If given, stages whose contract declares ``requires_gpu``
            while this is ``<= 0`` raise a warning.

    Returns:

Audio preprocessing stages.

These stages prepare audio for further processing:
- MonoConversionStage: Convert to mono and verify sample rate
- SegmentConcatenationStage: Concatenate multiple audio segments

Example:
    from nemo_curator.pipeline import Pipeline
    from nemo_curator.stages.audio.preprocessing import MonoConversionStage

    pipeline = Pipeline(name="preprocessing_pipeline")
    pipeline.add_stage(MonoConversionStage(output_sample_rate=48000))

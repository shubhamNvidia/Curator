class DocumentSplitter(ProcessingStage[DocumentBatch, DocumentBatch]):
    """
    Splits documents into segments based on a separator.
    Each segment becomes a new row within the batch with an additional column
    indicating the segment id.

    To restore the original document, ensure that each document
    has a unique id prior to splitting.

    Example:
        If a document has text="Hello\\n\\nWorld", and separator="\\n\\n",
        it will be split into two rows: one with text="Hello" and segment_id=0,
        and another with text="World" and segment_id=1.

    Args:
        separator (str): The separator to split the documents on.
        text_field (str): The name of the column containing the text to split.
            Defaults to "text".
        segment_id_field (str): The name of the column to add to indicate the segment id.
            Defaults to "segment_id".

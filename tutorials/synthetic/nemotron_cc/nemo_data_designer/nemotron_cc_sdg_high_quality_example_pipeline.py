NDD-backed NemotronCC SDG pipeline for high-quality data.

This is the NeMo Data Designer equivalent of
``tutorials/synthetic/nemotron_cc/nemotron_cc_sdg_high_quality_example_pipeline.py``.
Supports four tasks: diverse_qa, distill, extract_knowledge, knowledge_list.
Instead of using AsyncOpenAIClient + GenerationConfig directly, it configures
the LLM through NDD's ModelConfig / ModelProvider / ChatCompletionInferenceParams.

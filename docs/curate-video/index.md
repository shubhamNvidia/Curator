# About Video Curation

Learn what video curation is and how you use NeMo Curator to turn long videos into high‑quality, searchable clips.
Depending on the use case, this can involve processing 100+ PB of videos.
To efficiently process this quantity of videos, NeMo Curator provides highly optimized curation pipelines.

## Use Cases

Identify when to use NeMo Curator by matching your goals to common video curation scenarios.

* Generating clips for video world model training
* Generating clips for generative video model fine-tuning
* Creating a rich video database for video retrieval applications

## Architecture

Understand how components work together so you can plan, scale, and troubleshoot video pipelines. The following diagram outlines NeMo Curator's video curation architecture:

```{image} ../about/concepts/video/_images/video-pipeline-diagram.png
:alt: High-level outline of NeMo Curator's video curation architecture
```

```{note}
Video pipelines use the `XennaExecutor` backend by default, which provides optimized support for GPU-accelerated video processing including hardware decoders and encoders. You do not need to import or configure the executor unless you want to use an alternative backend. For more information about customizing backends, refer to [Pipeline Execution Backends](reference-execution-backends).

## Curation Tasks

Follow task-based guides to load, process, and write curated video data end to end.

### Load Data

Bring videos into your pipeline from local paths or remote sources you control.

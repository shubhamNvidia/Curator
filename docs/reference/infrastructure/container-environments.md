# Container Environments

Deploy NeMo Curator in containerized environments for reproducible, scalable data curation pipelines with pre-configured dependencies and optimized runtime settings.

## Overview

NeMo Curator provides official Docker containers with all dependencies pre-installed and optimized for production workloads. Containers offer:

- **Reproducible Environments**: Consistent software stack across development, testing, and production
- **Simplified Deployment**: No manual dependency installation or environment configuration
- **GPU Acceleration**: Pre-configured CUDA, cuDNN, and NVIDIA libraries for optimal performance
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Built-in support for text, image, video, and audio curation
- **Cloud-Ready**: Compatible with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and cloud container orchestries

**When to use containers:**
- Production deployments requiring consistency and reliability
- Multi-node cluster processing with identical environments
- CI/CD pipelines for automated data curation workflows
- Quick prototyping without local environment setup
- GPU-accelerated processing in cloud environments

## Available Containers

### Main NeMo Curator Container

The primary container includes comprehensive support for all curation modalities:

**Container registry:** `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo-curator:25.09`

**Supported modalities:**
- ✅ Text curation (CPU/GPU)
- ✅ Image curation (GPU required)
- ✅ Video curation (GPU required, FFmpeg included)
- ✅ Audio curation (GPU required for ASR)

**Pre-installed components:**
- NeMo Curator with all optional dependencies (`[all]` extras)
- CUDA 12.8.1 with cuDNN
- Python 3.12 with uv package manager
- FFmpeg 8+ with NVENC support (for video processing)
- Ray, Dask, and distributed computing frameworks
- NVIDIA optimized Python packages

## Environment Usage Examples

(reference-infrastructure-container-environments-usage-text)=

### Text Curation

Uses the default container environment with CPU or GPU workers depending on the module.

(reference-infrastructure-container-environments-usage-image)=

### Image Curation

Requires GPU-enabled workers in the container environment.
